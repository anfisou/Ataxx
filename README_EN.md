This project was developed for the subject 'Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science' and implements an [Ataxx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxx) game with a graphic interface. Youcan choose between
```player vs player```, ```player vs AI``` or ```AI vs AI```. Each one of the AI can play on 3 difficulty levels: ```Easy``` that plays randomly, ```Medium``` that choose the move that gains most pieces and ```Hard``` that uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

To play you only need the following libraries:  ```pygame``` and ```numpy```, you can install them using ```pip install pygame``` and ```pip install numpy```.

To run the game you need to execute ```python Ataxxgame.py```.
